AchSoExampleConnection
======================

Example app for communicating with [Ach so!][achso].

See `src/main/java/fi/aalto/legroup/achsoexampleconnection/ExampleActivity.java`

Player intents
--------------

Ach so! player can be launched from another apps using Android Intents.

See [Ach so! readme][achso-readme] for explanations of intents to launch Ach so! with.

Layers Box URL
--------------

Sharing the Layers Box URL is done using [`SharedPreferences`][sharedprefs] and `MODE_WORLD_READABLE`.
This technique is marked as deprecated and discouraged, but the alternatives seem even worse (using
databases, which is way more complicated and has the same risks, or writing plain files to the
users' directories, which would confuse the users).

Because the `SharedPreferences` are user readable the URL is encrypted before storing it. This is
done using [`CryptoHelper`][cryptohelper]. It can be installed from jCenter as
`fi.aalto.legroup:cryptohelper`. `CryptoHelper` requires an 128-bit base64 encoded key.

The secret key is stored in `src/main/res/values/secrets.xml`. In real apps this should be kept hidden
from source control. The key needs to be shared between all Layers apps that should be able to read
the shared properties.
